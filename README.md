## Getting Started

Check your development environment! You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) installed. The official Gatsby website also lists two articles regarding this topic:

- [Check your development environment](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/)

To copy and install this starter run this command (with "project-name" being the name of your folder you wish to install it in):

```
gatsby new project-name https://github.com/denvercoder/gatsby-starter-blog-template
cd project-name
npm run develop
```

### Building the site

```
npm run build
```

Copy the content of the `public` folder to your webhost or use a website like Netlify which automates that for you.

**Attention:** You also need to edit `static/robots.txt` to include your domain!
